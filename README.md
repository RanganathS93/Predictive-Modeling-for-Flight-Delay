# Predictive-Modeling-for-Flight-Delay

Project Overview:

I was provided with two datasets – Flight_history.csv, which contains details on outbound flights from NYC airports from January to June 2013, and Flight_test.csv, consisting of randomly selected unique flights from the month of July.

My primary challenge is to predict which flights will arrive late using the ‘lateflight’ outcome variable. A late flight is defined as arriving after the scheduled arrival time.

The Flight_test.csv dataset provides minimal information, including variables such as uniqueid, year, month, day, scheduled departure and arrival times, carrier, flight number, tail number, origin, destination, and the dependent variable 'lateflight

Objective:

My goal is to construct additional meta-variables from the Flight_history.csv dataset, append them to Flight_test.csv, and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of flight delays.
